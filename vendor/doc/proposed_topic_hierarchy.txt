General hierarchy for events sent:

<publisher>/<entity>/<entity-id>/<operation>

a. UI Manager requests for details of a scanned VIN:   

Req event   : mgr/vehicle/<VIN>/profile/req          ( Get profile details)
Resp event  : oms/vehicle/<VIN>/profile/details      ( Return Profile details)

b. Order Estimate Request from UI to OMS:

Req event   : mgr/vehicle/<vin>/order/new/estimate           (get estimate for order)
Res event   : oms/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/cost               (Return Cost)

c. OMS Checks Part Availability:

First check with warehouse:

Req event   : oms/part/<part-type>/avail/req           (Check availability)
Res event   : whs/part/<party-type/avail/res           (Availability)

If parts not in warehouse, check with vendor:

Req event   : oms/part/<part-type>/avail/req           (Check availability)
Res event   : vnd/part/<party-type/avail/res           (Availability)

d. New Order Request from UI to OMS: 

Req event   : mgr/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/place           (Place New Order)
Res event   : oms/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/ack               (Ack order reception)

As updates in the order stage are made, OMS sends updates back to UI:

OMS Sends event  : mgr/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/update           (Order Status Update)

In case the user wants to cancel an order after viewing the cost:

Req event   : mgr/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/cancel           (Cancel Order)
Res event   : oms/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/cancel/ack         

e. Once a new order is placed, the oms should get all orders from the vendor or warehouse:

For all orders:

Req event   : oms/part/<part-type>/req                (Get Part)
Res event   : whs/part/<party-type>/delivery          (Part Delivery)  

or            vnd/part/<party-type>/delivery

Once all parts are delivered, initiate the build!

OMS sends a messsage on: oms/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/assemble

Once the build is complete, the build Assemble Bot responds on: abt/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/finished

Finally, once the build is complete, the OMS sends an update to MGR: 

mgr/vehicle/<vin>/order/<order-id>/update
